# mini-slides

A minimal template for making html slides. 

Each slide goes in its own markdown file in `slides/`. Slides are "compiled"
with `makeSlides.py`. The output is a single html file - open it in your
browser and change slides with the arrow keys.

Alternatively you can go forwards with the space bar or by clicking on the
right half of the screen. Clicking on the left half of the screen goes
backwards.
